## Introduction

OldBoot is a new way to find hiker fellows and make friends.

## Status

Very very work in progress.

## Features/wishlist

1. Make it easy to find occasional hiker fellows.
2. Create maps easily and collaboratively (coming soon).
3. Go wild!

## Under the hood

This is my pet project where I can experiment new things. In particular, I want to understand how to build large scale web applications without using the Model-View-Controller pattern. Some ideas come from this great paper:
